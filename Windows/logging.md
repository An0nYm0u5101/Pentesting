#### PUTTY

PuTTY is a free SSH and Telnet client for Windows and Unix platforms. If you’re accessing servers via SSH from Windows, then this is a pretty common tool to use. 

To configure logging of your session, see the Session>Logging menu:

Set ‘Session Logging’ to ‘Printable output’.
‘Always append to end of an already existing log file’
Set ‘Log file name’ to ‘&Y&M&D_%T__putty.log’ (or, whatever you like).
 
Pro-Tip: This can be handy when manually dumping a plain text Cisco config. 

REGISTRY RECOVER RECENT IP 

Perhaps you’ve already disconnected from your target network and forgot to note down your IP? Good news!  You might be able to grab it from the registry (if you haven’t connected to a new network yet).
 
Pop open regedit.exe (or cmd line alternative) and browse to:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces\<Interface unique identifier>

WIRESHARK

Wireshark is a packet capture and protocol analysis tool. You could run it on the interface you’re testing to record all your traffic during a test. Beware, PCAPs can get big really fast.

In the interests of not using up all your hard drive space, we can use capture filters to trim the traffic to only the hosts in scope. 
 
For example, if you were doing a web application test, then you could use the following filter to only capture traffic between your source IP, the destination IP in scope, and on port 80:

host <target> and (port 80 or port 443)
Something to keep in mind is Wireshark, by default, doesn’t auto-save as you’re going along. So if it crashes you might lose the whole capture.
 
To protect against this, you can configure a permanent file to log to, under capture interfaces>Output:

 
You can also configure a ring buffer of files split by size and/or time. More info here:
