GWT is very suck to try and hack - because obfuscation and whatnot. Here are some things that helped me to hack GWT things:

### Basic overview:

Everything changes fairly regularly, so content that isn't updated is likely out of date (such as most of the sources I've linked). GWT is more or less a RPC style 'single page' thingo, it has fairly distinct request/response content. If you see requests and whatnot that look like:

```
7|0|7|URL GOES HERE|SOME HASH THING|STUFF|METHOD NAME?|STUFF|STUFF|STUFF|1|2|3|4|2|5|5|6|7|
```

it's probably GWT. Look at the google docs link for the reverse engineering of the protocol.

What we are interested in primarily, is finding endpoints that the client knows about, that the user isn't presented - admin controls, file upload functions etc. In practise, it's fairly hard to build something that will create a GWT request for you, but it can help to direct other activities.

### Finding RPC Endpoints

So you have a GWT app, and want to know what some of the endpoints are? Coolio, the first think you want to look for, is the `something.nocache.js` file in one of your requests. Fire up Burp, find that request. Inside that .js file, there will be a bunch of hashes somewhere - those are the cached versions of the client side script (well, some of them are, some of them are junk). For every hash you find in that nocache file, you will want to try and load up the file - you may have seen it fly through your Burp stuff also. I've found that it's generally the second last one in the nocache file, but many of these files are created by tooling for optimization, so no promises. There is likely a better way of identifying the file you want - let me know if you work it out.

Once we have a few client source files (they will be fairly large .js files), we can start trying to locate RPC endpoints. Naiively grepping for interesting strings is one way of doing so - but won't give you a huge amount of insight. The string you want to locate is `requestSerialized`. Find the method that is defined that uses that string - that method is effectively what seems to be 'makerequest', so anything that calls that method is likely something interesting to us.

Everything after this point is pretty implementation dependent, I've had limited success with some applications, only revealing 10 or so RPC methods and endpoints - with others basically everything comes out, hundreds of methods etc etc. 

Strings in the cached .js file are optimized by assigning them all to variables, and placing all of those variables at the end of the file - what this means is that some of your methods will look fairly boring, with a lot of garbage js. To make them more interesting - pick through the js, locate the potential strings, and find/replace them all until it starts looking like something you might want to hack.

To start you off - I have a python script that works 100% of the time about 40% of the time - no warranty etc. save your gwt cached client file as gwt.js and watch it use extremely complicated logic to pull out methods just like magic!

### Decombobulating Java Classes

I haven't found this useful, but the /p/degwt project (that appears to have been abandoned many years ago) has the ability to pull out some of the classess used. This works some of the time, but not all of the time. Copy the content from getclasses.js into your javascript console, and it should return a bunch of classes. I'm sure there is a better way of outputting the information. getclasses.js is copy-pasted from the /p/degwt project, and has the yui stuff removed.
